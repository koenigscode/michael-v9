        My coding journey began in 2016, and by 2017, I discovered an interest
        in web development, a passion I followed for several years
        (Vue/React/Next). Over the years, I have explored various other fields
        of software development, leading me to shift my main interest from
        frontend to backend development.
        <br /> <br />
        Apart from Software Engineering, I enjoy language learning (currently
        Swedish ~B2 and Russian ~A2), brewing beer/kombucha/mead/etc, and making
        espresso.
