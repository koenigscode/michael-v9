      I began working with Python in 2018 and was quickly drawn to its simplicity and versatility. In 2019, I shared my enthusiasm by teaching a 4-hour crash course at my high school. Since then, I've used Python extensively for general-purpose programming and machine learning projects, including work with scikit-learn.

        I've been using Spring Boot (Java) since I learnt it in school, and I've
        learnt to love it over the years - the ecosystem is huge, and it's easy
        to get started with.

        In university project teams, I'm usually the one who dockerizes
        everything, especially in larger teams and when working with new
        technologies â€“ it can be a time saver when it comes to locally setting
        up projects on everyone's machine. I'm also running over 15 Docker
        containers for various services on my "home server" (euphemism for "my
        old laptop"), since I believe it makes (re-)deployment easier.
