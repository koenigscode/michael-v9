          Entoothiast was developed as part of a university project and is a
          distributed system consisting of several services split across 8
          repos, to book and manage dentist appointments.
          <br />
          <br />
          The scheduling, logging, authentication and statistics service
          implement the main business logic, and an API gateway abstracts the
          previous services via a REST API, which is consumed by the Patient UI
          (Vue.js web app) and a Dentist UI (CLI written in JavaScript).
          <br />
          <br />
          My job was mainly to design and set up the system's architecture
          (using pm2 and Docker), making it horizontally scalable, and to
          implement the booking functionality and authentication service.
          <br />
          <br />
          We used the GitLab CI for automatically running integration tests that
          cover all backend services. We also conducted load tests on the system
          using locust to identify bottlenecks.

          We developed Plant Stein as a part of our university project, in an
          agile team of 6 people. It's a plant surveillance system that monitors
          temperature, humidity, brightness and soil moisture of your plants and
          notifies you when the plant isn't happy.

          The frontend is developed in Flutter, and the backend uses Spring Boot
          for the REST API and the database (using JPA). MQTT is used for
          receiving data from the microcontroller.

        WaSubby, built as part of a university project, is a web app that allows
        the user to transcribe video or audio files in their original language
        and translates the generated subtitles into English as well. The media
        can then be watched/listened to with the subtitles in both languages,
        which can be used for learning a new language.
        <br />
        <br />
        The backend uses OpenAI whisper, an AI-powered library for media file
        transcription.
